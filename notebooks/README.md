# Jetbot Labs

## Description

Official hands-on course materials for Jetbot course

## Part 1: Basic Motion

In this example we will control the Jetbot by programming from our web browser some basic motor controls

## Part 2: Road Following

In this example we will train the Jetbot to follow a line. The following four steps are required:

Step 1: Data Collection - We collect image regression dataset which will allow the Jetbot to follow the line.

Step 2: Train the model - We perform model training by using a famous technique known as Transfer Learning.

Step 3: Optimize the model - We optimize our trained model by using TensorRT for better performance on the Jetson Nano.

Step 4: Live demo - Finally we run the road following live inference on the Jetbot.

## Part 3: Collision Avoidance

## Part 4: Road Following + Collision Avoidance
